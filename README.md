### Nothing interesting for now, will come back to this repo sooner or later...
# UX
Set of small components (HTML, CSS, JS) which should have a positive impact on the UX of a web app.

## Ideas
- icons support, [clickable reactions](https://dev.to/binarforge/seven-useful-programming-habits) - [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/)
- loading bar - showing progress when reading an article - nicely done at a desktop version of [natemat.pl](http://natemat.pl/)
- highlighted text options - as [here](https://medium.com/@ttemplier/angular2-decorators-and-class-inheritance-905921dbd1b7)
- paragraph link - as [here](https://olingo.apache.org/doc/odata4/tutorials/action/tutorial_action.html#implement-an-action-processor)
- opening link in a new tab - option when `:hover`
- estimated reading time - calculating it somehow, [shown here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/); TL;DR option
