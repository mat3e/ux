# UX
Set of small components (HTML, CSS, JS) which should have a positive impact on the UX of a web app.

## List of nice libraries
- [Scrolline](https://github.com/anthonyly/Scrolline.js) - how much untill the end of the page
- [iziToast](https://github.com/dolce/iziToast) - perfect notifications
- [favico.js](https://github.com/ejci/favico.js) - whole new level of using favicons

## Ideas

- paragraph link - as [here](https://olingo.apache.org/doc/odata4/tutorials/action/tutorial_action.html#implement-an-action-processor)
- opening link in a new tab - option when `:hover`
- estimated reading time - calculating as on [Medium](https://medium.com/@ttemplier/angular2-decorators-and-class-inheritance-905921dbd1b7); TL;DR option
